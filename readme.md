# huniq 2

Command line utility to remove duplicates from the given input.

```
SYNOPSIS: huniq -h # Shows help
SYNOPSIS: huniq [-c|--count] [-0|--null|-d DELIM|--delim DELIM]
```

```
$ echo -e "foo\nbar\nfoo\nbaz" | huniq
foo
bar
baz

$ echo -e "foo\nbar\nfoo\nbaz" | huniq -c
1 baz
1 bar
2 foo
```

`huniq` replaces `sort | uniq` and `huniq -c` replaces `sort | uniq -c`.

The order of the output is stable when in normal mode, but it is not stable when
in -c/count mode.

## Motivation

Sorting is slow and requires lot's of memory. By using hash tables/hash sets instead of sorting
the input huniq is generally faster and requires less memory than the combination of `sort` and `uniq.`

## Version History

Version 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/SoftwearDevelopment/huniq).

Changes made in version 2:

* The -d/-0 flags where added so you can specify custom delimiters
* Completely rewritten in rust.
